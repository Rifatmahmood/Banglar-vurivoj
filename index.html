                <p> Kala Bhuna (Bengali: কালা ভুনা, Chittagonian: হালা ভুনো, romanized: Hala Bhuno) is a famous dark and
                    tender dish native to Chittagong prepared with shoulder pieces of beef and traditional spices;
                    usually served during Mezban. It was originally served during the early 17th century. However, the
                    origin of the dish is unknown. Bhuna (Chittagonian) means deep-frying; derived from Bhunna (Urdu)
                    meaning to be fried and the word Kala means dark or black in Chittagonian.
